        <p class="body-text">During the summer of 2016, I worked in a local branch of Thermo Fisher Scientific as a
            Software Engineering Intern. There, I speed-learned the basics of web development using the <a
                    href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a> framework. I was able to refresh my
            knowledge of HTML/CSS and Python while learning <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank">JQuery</a>,
            git, terminal, and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>. I used my
            newly-acquired skills to develop a CRUD app that allows users to enter, edit, and delete experiment data
            from a sortable table. Each experiment entry would then automatically link to the list of run results based
            on the experiment ID. This table included a dropdown list of columns so users can hide certain columns if
            they desire.</p>
        <p class="body-text">I was also the Co-Founder and former President of my school's Computer Science Club. While
            I was in charge of the club, I organized trips, guest speakers, and a light hackathon. The two trips I
            organized were a trip to New Jersey for the <a href="http://www.hackru.org/" target="_blank">HackRU</a>
            hackathon, and a trip to New York for a tour of the Spotify offices. The guest speakers included people with
            startups and startup ideas, a man from <a href="http://newhaven.io/" target="_blank">NewHaven.IO</a>, and a
            Senior Technical Evangelist from Microsoft. The light hackathon, known as <a href="http://femhack.tech/"
                                                                                         target="_blank">FemHack</a>,
            was an 8-hour hackathon exclusively for girls in grade school. This was part of the YouthZone component to
            the biennial <a
                    href="https://www.southernct.edu/academics/schools/arts/departments/womensstudies/annualconference/"
                    target="_blank">Women's Studies Conference</a>, hosted by my university's Women's Studies
            department.</p>
